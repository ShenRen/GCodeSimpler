GCodeSimpler
======

GCodeSimpler is a replacement of old GCodeTransfer tool which converts standard G-Code to obscure proprietary xj3dp format.

Features
======

The improvement to the former was focused on UI and output format.

1. The UI was reformed to a more straight forward drag-and-drop-based one which request no parameters and makes it easier to use.
2. The output format ~~was changed to "xj3dp1" to avoid conflict with new gcode-based xj3dp format (meaningly v2)~~ has retained "xj3dp" to keep compatibility with older machines.
