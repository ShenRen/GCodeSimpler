GCodeSimpler
======

GCodeSimpler is a replacement of old GCodeTransfer tool which converts standard Gcode to obscure proprietary xj3dp format.

Features
======

The improvement to the former one is focused on UI and output format.

1. The UI was reformed to a more straight forward drag-and-drop-based one which avoids unnecessary parameters and makes it easier to use.
2. The output format was changed to "xj3dp1" to avoid conflict with new gcode-based xj3dp format (meaningly v2).
